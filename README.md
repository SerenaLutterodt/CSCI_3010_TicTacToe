# How To Run:
./TicTacToe

# Description
Our tic tac toe game creates a board of salt, with alphabetical location options for the user to move to. On the game side, we prompt out user to tell us which location they want to be their next move, and appropriately mark their chosen location.
On the functional side, we had a function that created the bounds of the board itself, using a for loop with 9 iterations, creating the 3x3 board. We then had a switch case function, which connected the alphabetical locations to their actual locations on the board- I. E. Placing the markers. Thereâ€™s a function which displays the board and another which asks for the users input as to which location they want to move to. 
The main function ties everything together by calling and executing the previous declared functions, and displaying a working tic tac for board game.
